How to compile my Mish:
you can compile using either:
    (1) g++ -o <exe name> mish.cpp
    (2) g++ -o <exe name> -Wall -Werror -O mish.cpp

After it has compiled, you can run it in 2 ways:
    (1) run it with terminal prompting using:
        .\<exe name>
    (2) run it with file input using:
        .\<exe name> <file name>

    NOTE: this program only works with a singluar provided file, if you try and pass > 1, it will not run
